## Series Abstract

The TaiChi Series explores Tai Chi not merely as a martial or meditative technique, but as an embodied philosophy of adaptive intelligence. Through seven essays, the series articulates yielding, centering, process-awareness, and lived attention as practical capacities for navigating complexity in contemporary life.

Rather than emphasizing performance or mastery, these essays frame Tai Chi as a discipline of sustained relational presence — cultivating responsiveness, timing, structural awareness, and continuity between stillness and motion.
