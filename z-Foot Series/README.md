## Series Abstract

The Food Series explores eating not as fuel optimization but as an embodied cultural practice. Through a manifesto and nine essays, it reframes meals as relational events — linking attention, seasonal rhythm, sensory intelligence, and everyday care.

Rather than emphasizing nutrition metrics or performance, this series presents the table as a site of lived awareness. Cooking, tasting, and sharing become disciplines of presence that integrate movement, touch, and nourishment within the broader HanFlow framework.
